## Technologies Used

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en): JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Superset of JavaScript for better type safety and developer experience.
- [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js.
- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): NoSQL database for storing book records.
- [**Mongoose**](https://mongoosejs.com/): ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/): Testing framework.
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/): For containerizing the application.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: This project uses Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications. Ensure it is installed alongside Docker.


1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bygt/book-management-system.git

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
   cd book-managament-system
    
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
   npm install

4. **Set up environment variables and Docker-Compose.yml Mongo URI**
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri    

5. **Build the docker image**:
    ```bash
   docker-compose build

## Runnig the Application

6. **Run the development server with Docker:** üêã
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   
2. **Using npm: If you prefer to run the application without Docker, you can also use**
    ```bash
   npm run dev

### Accessing the Application

After the application is running, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:*port* in your web browser, where *port* is the port specified in your docker-compose.yml file (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
